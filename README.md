<h2>What I do</h2>
My specialities encompass all things Cloud Security, Secure Software and DevSecOps. My mission is to secure from the ground up, from the software to the metal it is running on (primarily Azure, AWS, GCP and OCI).

<h2>My background</h2>
I started tinkering with computers at a young age, but formalised my education in practical Cyber Security at bachelors level and then more conceptual Computer Science at masters level. I've lived and worked in various countries, from Europe to East Asia.
