<h2>What I do</h2>
My specialities encompass all things Cloud Security, Secure Software and DevSecOps. My mission is to secure from the ground up, from the software to the metal it is running on (primarily Azure, AWS, GCP and OCI).

<h2>My background</h2>
I started tinkering with computers at a young age, but formalised my education at bachelors and masters level.

I am a former Microsoft employee and was part of both their Internship and Graduate programs (Aspire).
