  Currently employed at Microsoft as a Customer Engineer in the Applications and Infrastructure domain, I am actively working with TypeScript, Node, Python, C# and Kusto Query Language. I work primarily with Cloud-native cybersecurity solutions, utilising programmatic techniques to enable customers to improve their security processes. I'm aspiring to learn more about Software Engineering practises and build my own solutions.
